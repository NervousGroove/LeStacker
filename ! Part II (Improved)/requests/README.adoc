= Python Requests Library Tutorial

This comprehensive tutorial provides an in-depth understanding of the `requests` library in Python, covering HTTP requests, response handling, authentication, sessions, and practical examples.

== Introduction to the requests Library

The `requests` library in Python simplifies making HTTP requests, interacting with APIs, and working with web resources. It provides an easy-to-use interface for sending HTTP requests and processing responses.

== Making GET Requests

The `requests` library enables you to make GET requests to retrieve information from web resources.

[source,python]
----
import requests

# Making a GET request
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
print("Response:", response.text)
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
----

== Handling JSON Responses

When working with APIs, you often receive JSON responses that you can parse using the `json()` method.

[source,python]
----
import requests

# Making a GET request and parsing JSON response
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
print("Parsed JSON:", data)
----

== Passing Query Parameters

You can pass query parameters with your requests using the `params` parameter.

[source,python]
----
import requests

# Making a GET request with query parameters
params = {'page': 1, 'limit': 10}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/posts', params=params)
print("Response:", response.text)
----

== Making POST Requests

The `requests` library also supports making POST requests to send data to web resources.

[source,python]
----
import requests

# Making a POST request with data
data = {'username': 'john_doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/users', data=data)
print("Response:", response.text)
----

== Authentication

You can handle authentication using the `auth` parameter.

[source,python]
----
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Making a GET request with basic authentication
auth = HTTPBasicAuth('username', 'password')
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/secure-data', auth=auth)
print("Response:", response.text)
----

== Sessions

Sessions help maintain state across multiple requests, such as handling cookies and other data.

[source,python]
----
import requests

# Creating a session
session = requests.Session()

# Making requests using the session
response = session.get('https://api.example.com/login')
response = session.post('https://api.example.com/process', data={'key': 'value'})
print("Response:", response.text)
----

== Error Handling

The `requests` library provides built-in error handling for HTTP errors.

[source,python]
----
import requests

# Handling errors
try:
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/nonexistent')
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an exception if the response status code indicates an error
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    print("HTTP Error:", e)
----

== Conclusion

The `requests` library in Python simplifies working with HTTP requests and APIs. This tutorial covered key features of the `requests` library, including making GET and POST requests, handling JSON responses, passing query parameters, authentication, using sessions, and error handling.

By mastering the `requests` library, you can seamlessly integrate web requests and API interactions into your Python applications, making it an essential tool for data retrieval and communication with web resources.

For further exploration and advanced applications, refer to the official `requests` documentation (https://docs.python-requests.org/).

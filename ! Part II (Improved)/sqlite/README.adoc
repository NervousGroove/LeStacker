= SQLite in Python Tutorial

This comprehensive tutorial provides an in-depth understanding of using the SQLite database in Python, covering database creation, table management, data insertion, querying, and practical examples.

== Introduction to SQLite in Python

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database engine that's widely used for local storage and small-scale applications. It's particularly well-suited for embedding in Python applications due to its simplicity and ease of use.

== Creating a Database

To work with SQLite in Python, you need to import the `sqlite3` module and connect to a database.

[source,python]
----
import sqlite3

# Connect to or create a database
conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
----

== Creating Tables

SQLite allows you to create tables for storing structured data.

[source,python]
----
# Create a cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a users table
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    email TEXT
)
''')
----

== Inserting Data

You can insert data into tables using SQL statements.

[source,python]
----
# Insert data into the users table
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO users (username, email)
VALUES (?, ?)
''', ('john_doe', 'john@example.com'))

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()
----

== Querying Data

SQLite supports querying data using SQL statements.

[source,python]
----
# Query all users
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
users = cursor.fetchall()
for user in users:
    print(user)
----

== Filtering and Ordering

You can filter and order query results using SQL statements.

[source,python]
----
# Query users with a specific email domain
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE ?', ('%@gmail.com',))
gmail_users = cursor.fetchall()

# Query users ordered by username
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY username')
ordered_users = cursor.fetchall()
----

== Updating Data

Updating data is achieved through SQL statements.

[source,python]
----
# Update a user's email
cursor.execute('UPDATE users SET email = ? WHERE username = ?', ('new_email@example.com', 'john_doe'))
conn.commit()
----

== Deleting Data

You can delete data using SQL statements as well.

[source,python]
----
# Delete a user
cursor.execute('DELETE FROM users WHERE username = ?', ('john_doe',))
conn.commit()
----

== Conclusion

SQLite is a powerful choice for local storage and small-scale applications in Python. This tutorial covered key features of SQLite in Python, including database creation, table management, data insertion, querying, filtering, ordering, updating, and deleting data.

By mastering SQLite, you gain the ability to efficiently manage structured data within your Python applications, making it an excellent tool for projects that require lightweight and embedded database functionality.

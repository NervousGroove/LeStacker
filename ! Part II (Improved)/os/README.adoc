= Python os Module Tutorial

This comprehensive tutorial provides a detailed understanding of the `os` module in Python, covering file and directory operations, environment variables, process management, and more.

== Introduction to the os Module

The `os` module is an essential component of Python's standard library, allowing developers to interact with the underlying operating system. It offers functions and tools for various tasks, making it a cornerstone for managing files, directories, processes, and more.

== File and Directory Operations

The `os` module provides functions to work with files and directories, offering convenience and efficiency in managing filesystem-related tasks.

[source,python]
----
import os

# Get the current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()

# List contents of a directory
contents = os.listdir(current_dir)

# Create a new directory
new_dir = os.path.join(current_dir, "new_directory")
os.mkdir(new_dir)

# Rename a file or directory
old_name = "old_name.txt"
new_name = "new_name.txt"
os.rename(old_name, new_name)

# Delete a file or directory
file_to_delete = "file_to_delete.txt"
directory_to_delete = "directory_to_delete"
os.remove(file_to_delete)
os.rmdir(directory_to_delete)
----

== Path Manipulation

The `os.path` submodule offers path manipulation functions to ensure compatibility across different operating systems.

[source,python]
----
file_path = os.path.join("folder", "file.txt")
absolute_path = os.path.abspath(file_path)
basename = os.path.basename(file_path)
dirname = os.path.dirname(file_path)
normalized_path = os.path.normpath(file_path)
----

== Environment Variables

Working with environment variables is crucial for configuration management. The `os` module simplifies access and manipulation of environment variables.

[source,python]
----
# Get the value of an environment variable
username = os.environ.get("USERNAME")

# Set an environment variable
os.environ["MY_VARIABLE"] = "value"

# Remove an environment variable
if "MY_VARIABLE" in os.environ:
    del os.environ["MY_VARIABLE"]
----

== File and Directory Information

Understanding file and directory attributes is essential. The `os` module provides functions to retrieve file information.

[source,python]
----
file_size = os.path.getsize("file.txt")
is_file = os.path.isfile("file.txt")
is_directory = os.path.isdir("folder")
file_stats = os.stat("file.txt")
----

== Working with Paths

Manipulating file paths effectively ensures compatibility across different operating systems. The `os.path` submodule offers functions to validate and manipulate paths.

[source,python]
----
path = "/path/to/file.txt"

# Check if a path exists
exists = os.path.exists(path)

# Check if a path is a file or directory
is_file = os.path.isfile(path)
is_directory = os.path.isdir(path)

# Normalize a path
normalized_path = os.path.normpath(path)
----

== Running Shell Commands

Executing shell commands from within Python can be powerful for automation and integration. The `os` module provides ways to run shell commands and capture their output.

[source,python]
----
command = "ls -l"
result = os.popen(command).read()

# Run a command and capture output
output = os.system("ls -l")

# Run a command and capture output as a list
output_list = os.popen("ls").readlines()
----

== Process Management

Managing processes is essential for orchestrating system tasks and integrations. The `os` module offers functions to interact with processes.

[source,python]
----
# Run an external program
program_path = "/path/to/program"
os.system(program_path)

# Spawn a new process
os.spawnlp(os.P_NOWAIT, "python", "python", "script.py")

# Get the process ID
process_id = os.getpid()
process_group_id = os.getpgrp()
----

== File Permissions

Understanding and managing file permissions is crucial for securing sensitive data and files. The `os` module provides functions for accessing and modifying permissions.

[source,python]
----
# Get file permissions
permissions = os.stat("file.txt").st_mode

# Change file permissions
new_permissions = permissions | stat.S_IEXEC
os.chmod("file.txt", new_permissions)
----

== Handling Signals

The `os` module also enables handling signals, allowing you to react to various events and conditions.

[source,python]
----
import signal

# Handle a specific signal
def handle_signal(signum, frame):
    print(f"Received signal {signum}")

# Register signal handler
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handle_signal)
----

== Directory Tree Walk

The ability to traverse directory trees is crucial for tasks such as searching for specific files or performing batch operations. The `os` module provides a way to walk through directories.

[source,python]
----
def print_directory_contents(path):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        print(f"Current directory: {root}")
        print("Subdirectories:", dirs)
        print("Files:", files)
----

== File Operations

The `os` module extends its capabilities to various file operations, including copying and moving files.

[source,python]
----
source_file = "source.txt"
destination_file = "destination.txt"

# Copy a file
os.copy(source_file, destination_file)

# Move a file
os.rename(source_file, destination_file)
----

== Conclusion

The `os` module is a versatile and indispensable part of Python's standard library, empowering developers to interact with the operating system at various levels. This tutorial covered a comprehensive range of features within the `os` module, including file and directory operations, path manipulation, environment variables, file and directory information, working with paths, running shell commands, process management, file permissions, signal handling, directory tree traversal, and file operations.

By understanding and mastering the `os` module, you'll be equipped with powerful tools to manage various aspects of your applications across different operating systems.

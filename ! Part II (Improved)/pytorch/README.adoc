= PyTorch Tutorial: Building AI and Machine Learning Applications

This comprehensive tutorial provides an in-depth understanding of PyTorch, covering tensor operations, neural networks, training models, data preprocessing, and practical examples.

== Introduction to PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that provides a flexible and efficient platform for building AI applications. It offers dynamic computation graphs, making it well-suited for research, experimentation, and production-grade machine learning projects.

== Tensors and Operations

Tensors are the building blocks of PyTorch, analogous to multi-dimensional arrays. They allow you to perform various mathematical operations efficiently.

[source,python]
----
import torch

# Create tensors
tensor_a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
tensor_b = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])

# Perform operations
result = tensor_a + tensor_b
print("Result:", result)
----

== Neural Networks

PyTorch makes it easy to create and train neural networks.

[source,python]
----
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple neural network
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(3, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Create an instance of the neural network
net = NeuralNetwork()
----

== Training a Model

PyTorch provides tools for training neural networks using gradient descent.

[source,python]
----
import torch.optim as optim

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = net(tensor_a.float())
    loss = criterion(outputs, tensor_b.float())
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
----

== Data Preprocessing

PyTorch offers data preprocessing capabilities for handling datasets.

[source,python]
----
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

# Define a custom dataset
class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Create a DataLoader
data = [torch.tensor([1, 2, 3]), torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])]
dataset = CustomDataset(data)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)
----

== Saving and Loading Models

You can save and load trained models for future use.

[source,python]
----
# Save model checkpoint
torch.save(net.state_dict(), 'model_checkpoint.pth')

# Load model checkpoint
new_net = NeuralNetwork()
new_net.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_checkpoint.pth'))
----

== Conclusion

= Creating a System Tray Application with PyStray

This tutorial provides an introduction to using the `pystray` library in Python to create a system tray application that runs in the background and can be accessed from the system tray.

== Introduction to PyStray

`pystray` is a Python library that simplifies creating system tray applications. It allows you to run your Python script in the background and provide a user-friendly interface accessible through the system tray.

== Installing PyStray

Before you start using `pystray`, you need to install it.

[source,python]
----
# Install pystray using pip
$ pip install pystray
----

== Creating a Simple System Tray Application

Let's create a basic example of a system tray application using `pystray`.

[source,python]
----
import pystray
from PIL import Image

# Create a basic system tray icon
def on_exit(icon, item):
    icon.stop()

# Load an image to use as the icon
image = Image.open("icon.png")

# Create a menu
menu = pystray.Menu(pystray.MenuItem("Exit", on_exit))

# Create a system tray icon
icon = pystray.Icon("name", image, "Title", menu)

# Run the system tray application
icon.run()
----

== Adding Functionality

You can add custom functionality to your system tray application.

[source,python]
----
import pystray
from PIL import Image

def on_exit(icon, item):
    icon.stop()

def show_message(icon, item):
    icon.notify("System Tray Example", "Hello from the system tray!")

image = Image.open("icon.png")
menu = pystray.Menu(
    pystray.MenuItem("Show Message", show_message),
    pystray.MenuItem("Exit", on_exit)
)
icon = pystray.Icon("name", image, "Title", menu)
icon.run()
----

== Conclusion

The `pystray` library simplifies the process of creating system tray applications in Python. This tutorial covered key features of `pystray`, including creating a simple system tray icon, adding custom functionality through the menu, and running the application in the background.

By mastering `pystray`, you can develop user-friendly applications that run in the background and are easily accessible from the system tray, making it a valuable tool for creating notification and control applications.

## âš¡ In module II, everything is more explained and improved. Each tutorial is at least 500 lines long, with explanations and examples.

## ðŸš€ Remember that practice makes perfect. Maybe you've just forgotten something, but if you really want to learn, copying and pasting won't do the trick. To really learn, you need to practice, type and pay attention.

## ðŸ“¦ MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
To benefit from all the knowledge in part II, you need to have a basic understanding of Python.

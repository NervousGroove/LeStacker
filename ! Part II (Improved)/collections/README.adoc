= Python collections Module Tutorial

This comprehensive tutorial provides an in-depth understanding of the `collections` module in Python, covering its various data structures, such as `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, and `namedtuple`, along with practical examples.

== Introduction to the collections Module

The `collections` module in Python extends the built-in data structures, providing enhanced alternatives to the standard containers. These specialized data structures are designed to offer improved performance and capabilities for various scenarios.

== Counter: Counting Elements

The `Counter` class provides a simple and efficient way to count elements within an iterable.

[source,python]
----
from collections import Counter

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
fruit_counter = Counter(fruits)

print(fruit_counter)
print(f"Most common fruit: {fruit_counter.most_common(1)}")
----

== defaultdict: Default Values for Missing Keys

The `defaultdict` class is a dictionary that automatically generates default values for missing keys.

[source,python]
----
from collections import defaultdict

# Create a defaultdict with default value of int
gradebook = defaultdict(int)

# Add grades for students
gradebook["Alice"] = 90
gradebook["Bob"] = 85

# Access a missing key (generates default value)
print(gradebook["Charlie"])
print(gradebook)
----

== deque: Double-Ended Queue

The `deque` class implements a double-ended queue, enabling efficient operations at both ends.

[source,python]
----
from collections import deque

# Create a deque
queue = deque(["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"])

# Append and pop from both ends
queue.append("David")
queue.appendleft("Eva")
queue.pop()
queue.popleft()

print(queue)
----

== namedtuple: Named Tuple

The `namedtuple` class creates a new type of tuple with named fields.

[source,python]
----
from collections import namedtuple

# Create a named tuple type
Person = namedtuple("Person", ["name", "age", "city"])

# Create instances of named tuple
person1 = Person("Alice", 25, "New York")
person2 = Person("Bob", 30, "Los Angeles")

print(person1.name)
print(person2.age)
----

== OrderedDict: Preserving Order of Elements

The `OrderedDict` class maintains the order of dictionary elements, useful when iteration order matters.

[source,python]
----
from collections import OrderedDict

# Create an ordered dictionary
ordered_dict = OrderedDict()
ordered_dict["a"] = 1
ordered_dict["b"] = 2
ordered_dict["c"] = 3

# Print keys in insertion order
print(list(ordered_dict.keys()))
----

== ChainMap: Combining Multiple Dictionaries

The `ChainMap` class allows you to combine multiple dictionaries into a single view.

[source,python]
----
from collections import ChainMap

dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}
combined_dict = ChainMap(dict1, dict2)

print(combined_dict["a"])
print(combined_dict["b"])
print(combined_dict["c"])
----

== Conclusion

The `collections` module in Python provides specialized data structures beyond the built-in containers, enhancing your ability to handle various scenarios efficiently. This tutorial covered key data structures, including `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple`, `OrderedDict`, and `ChainMap`, along with practical examples.

By mastering the `collections` module, you can optimize your code by using the right data structure for the task at hand, improving performance and readability.

== 1. Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

== 2. Python Basics

Learn the basics of Python syntax and data types:

[source,python]
----
# Your first Python program
print("Hello, Python!")

# Variables and data types
age = 25
name = "John"
is_student = True
pi = 3.14159
----

== 3. Control Structures

Understand control structures like if statements, loops, and more:

[source,python]
----
# if statement
if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult.")
else:
    print("You're a minor.")

# for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# while loop
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
----

== 4. Functions and Modules

Learn to create functions and organize your code using modules:

[source,python]
----
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

# Using a module
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))
----

== 5. Data Structures

Explore essential data structures in Python:

[source,python]
----
# Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Tuples
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Dictionaries
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Sets
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}
----

== 6. Object-Oriented Programming

Learn the basics of OOP with classes and objects:

[source,python]
----
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}."

person = Person("Bob", 25)
print(person.greet())
----

== 7. File Handling

Understand reading and writing files in Python:

[source,python]
----
# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, file!")

# Reading from a file
with open("input.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
----

== 8. Exception Handling

Learn to handle errors and exceptions gracefully:

[source,python]
----
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero.")
----

== 9. Regular Expressions

Explore pattern matching with regular expressions:

[source,python]
----
import re

text = "Hello, my email is user@example.com."
pattern = r"\b\w+@\w+\.\w+\b"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)
----

== 10. Functional Programming

Understand functional programming concepts in Python:

[source,python]
----
# Map
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

# Filter
even = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
----

== 11. Debugging and Testing

Learn to debug and write tests for your code:

[source,python]
----
# Debugging
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Division by zero."
    return a / b

# Testing
import unittest

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
----

== 12. Python Libraries

Explore popular Python libraries for various purposes:

[source,python]
----
# Web development: Flask
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

# Data analysis: Pandas
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Machine learning: Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
----

== 13. Advanced Topics

Dive into advanced topics like decorators, generators, context managers, and more:

[source,python]
----
# Decorators
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Generators
def fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Context managers
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
----

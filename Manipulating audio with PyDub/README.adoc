= PyDub Tutorial

This tutorial introduces PyDub, a user-friendly library for audio manipulation and editing in Python.

== Introduction to PyDub

PyDub is a versatile library for audio manipulation tasks in Python. It provides an easy-to-use interface for working with audio files, including editing, slicing, concatenating, applying effects, and more.

== Installation and Setup

To get started with PyDub, install it using pip:

[source,shell]
----
pip install pydub
----

== Opening and Saving Audio

Learn to open and save audio files using PyDub:

[source,python]
----
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Open an audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("audio.mp3")

# Save the audio in different format
audio.export("output.wav", format="wav")
----

== Basic Audio Manipulations

Explore basic audio manipulation functions in PyDub:

[source,python]
----
# Adjust audio volume
louder_audio = audio + 10

# Trim audio
trimmed_audio = audio[5000:10000]

# Concatenate audio
combined_audio = audio1 + audio2
----

== Audio Effects

Apply various audio effects using PyDub:

[source,python]
----
# Apply audio fade in/out
fade_in_audio = audio.fade_in(2000)
fade_out_audio = audio.fade_out(2000)

# Apply high-pass filter
high_pass_audio = audio.high_pass_filter(1000)
----

== Audio Slicing and Concatenation

Slice and concatenate audio segments with PyDub:

[source,python]
----
# Slice audio
segment1 = audio[:5000]
segment2 = audio[5000:10000]

# Concatenate segments
concatenated_audio = segment1 + segment2
----

== Exporting Audio

Export audio with different options in PyDub:

[source,python]
----
# Export audio with different bit rate
audio.export("output.mp3", format="mp3", bitrate="192k")

# Export audio with different sample rate
audio.export("output.wav", format="wav", parameters=["-ar", "44100"])
----

== Changing Audio Format

Change audio format and parameters using PyDub:

[source,python]
----
# Convert audio to different format
converted_audio = audio.export(format="ogg")

# Convert stereo audio to mono
mono_audio = audio.set_channels(1)
----

== Audio Playback

Play back audio in PyDub using system default player:

[source,python]
----
# Play audio
audio.export("temp.wav", format="wav")
audio.play()
----

== Audio Analysis

Perform basic audio analysis with PyDub:

[source,python]
----
# Calculate audio duration
duration = len(audio) / 1000  # in seconds

# Get audio channels
channels = audio.channels

# Get audio sample rate
sample_rate = audio.frame_rate
----

== Conclusion

PyDub is a user-friendly library for audio manipulation and editing tasks in Python. This tutorial introduced you to basic PyDub functionalities, including opening and saving audio, audio manipulation, applying effects, slicing and concatenation, exporting audio, changing audio format, audio playback, and basic audio analysis.

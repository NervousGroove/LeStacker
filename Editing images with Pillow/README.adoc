= Pillow Tutorial

This tutorial introduces Pillow, a powerful library for image processing in Python.

== Introduction to Pillow

Pillow is a friendly fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) that adds enhancements and support for more image file formats. It provides a wide range of image manipulation capabilities.

== Installation and Setup

To get started with Pillow, install it using pip:

[source,shell]
----
pip install Pillow
----

== Opening and Displaying Images

Learn to open and display images using Pillow:

[source,python]
----
from PIL import Image

# Open an image
image = Image.open("image.jpg")

# Display the image
image.show()
----

== Basic Image Manipulations

Explore basic image manipulation functions in Pillow:

[source,python]
----
# Resize an image
small_image = image.resize((300, 200))

# Rotate an image
rotated_image = image.rotate(45)

# Crop an image
cropped_image = image.crop((100, 100, 400, 300))
----

== Image Filtering

Apply various filters to images using Pillow:

[source,python]
----
from PIL import ImageFilter

# Apply a blur filter
blurred_image = image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)

# Apply an edge enhancement filter
sharp_image = image.filter(ImageFilter.EDGE_ENHANCE)
----

== Adding Text and Drawing

Add text and draw shapes on images:

[source,python]
----
from PIL import ImageDraw, ImageFont

# Draw on an image
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
draw.rectangle((100, 100, 300, 200), outline="red", width=2)
draw.text((150, 50), "Hello, Pillow!", fill="blue")

# Load a font
font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", size=36)
draw.text((100, 300), "Custom Font", fill="green", font=font)
----

== Image Enhancements

Enhance images using Pillow's functions:

[source,python]
----
# Convert an image to grayscale
grayscale_image = image.convert("L")

# Adjust image brightness
brightened_image = Image.eval(image, lambda px: px + 50)
----

== Image Formats and Saving

Pillow supports various image formats, and you can save images in different formats:

[source,python]
----
# Save an image in JPEG format
image.save("output.jpg")

# Save an image in PNG format
image.save("output.png")

# Save an image in GIF format
image.save("output.gif")
----

== Image Manipulation Pipeline

Create a pipeline for multiple image manipulations:

[source,python]
----
from PIL import ImageEnhance

# Open an image
image = Image.open("image.jpg")

# Resize
image = image.resize((800, 600))

# Apply enhancements
enhancer = ImageEnhance.Brightness(image)
brightened_image = enhancer.enhance(1.5)

# Save the final image
brightened_image.save("final_image.jpg")
----

== Conclusion

Pillow is a versatile library for image processing in Python. This tutorial introduced you to basic Pillow functionalities, including opening and displaying images, performing manipulations like resizing, rotating, cropping, filtering, adding text and drawing, enhancing images, and saving in different formats.
